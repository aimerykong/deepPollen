Airyscan microscopy, automated classification, Detarioideae, machine learning, palynology.

**Significance Statement**: 
By combining optical superresolution with deep learning classification methods, we demonstrate that it is possible to taxonomically separate pollen grains that appear morphologically similar under light microscopy. This new approach improves the taxonomic resolution of pollen identifications and greatly enhances the use of pollen data in ecological and evolutionary research.


## Abstract

Taxonomic resolution is a major challenge in palynology, largely limiting the ecological and evolutionary interpretations possible with deep-time fossil pollen data. We present a new approach for fossil pollen analysis that uses optical superresolution microscopy and machine learning to create a higher throughput and quantitative workflow for producing palynological identifications and hypotheses of biological affinity. We developed three convolutional neural network (CNN) classification models: maximum projection (MPM), multi-slice (MSM), and fused (FM). We trained the models on 16 genera of modern Amherstieae pollen, and then used them to constrain the biological classifications of 48 fossil Striatopollis specimens from the Paleocene, Eocene, and Miocene of western Africa and northern South America. All models achieved average accuracies of 83 - 90% in the classification of the modern genera, and the majority of fossil identifications (86%) showed consensus among at least two of the three models. Our fossil identifications support the paleobiogeographic hypothesis that Amherstieae originated in Paleocene Africa and dispersed to South America during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (56 Ma). They also raise the possibility that at least three Amherstieae genera (Crudia, Berlinia, and Anthonotha) may have diverged earlier in the Cenozoic than predicted by molecular phylogenies.
